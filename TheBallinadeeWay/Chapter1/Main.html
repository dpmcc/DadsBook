        The first tale on our journey through the history of Ballinadee is associated with the attractive stone bridge and the tranquil Pound River that flows beneath. This crossing is traversed by many; either as a means for locals to go about their daily journeys or as a welcoming entrance for curious visitors. How many of these passers-by are aware of past travellers who ventured on desperate quests to reach the very same spot? Or of the horror and tragedy that was inflicted on them and the hope that lay in their destination. As you pass in and out of this village, it is hard to imagine that only just over a century and a half ago, the picturesque village of Ballinadee, which today presents an often serene and calm impression to the outside world, was a centre of tremendous grief, torment and anguish. Unknown to the majority of its present inhabitants, Ballinadee was a beacon of hope in the most desperate of times. The Great Irish Famine of 1845 to 1850 was an era when widespread hunger and disease cast a great shadow over the land. Before the Famine, Ballinadee was a centre for large-scale production of food stuffs. When the great need occurred, the giant Mill, driven by the flow of the Pound River, sustained not only its populace, but a vast influx of starving people who walked, crawled and died upon our fields and our country lanes, as they made their pitiful way to Ballinadee mill and the precious food it bestowed.

    <p> The Mill’s remains are situated close to the village bridge but the force required to power it was ingeniously created further up river by augmenting the flow of the Pound. Production was driven by a giant fifty-two bucket, twenty-six feet high, ‘over shot’ mill wheel similar to the one shown in the picture below. </p>
<p>
To turn this enormous mechanism the flow of the river was artificially diverted some miles up stream. At a point where the height of the river was at a suitable level a mill pond and dam were built to store the river’s energy and release its flow in a more pressurised way. From this dam a canal was dug which ran alongside the Pound but maintained its original height as it flowed through the higher ground. This canal ran all the way down to the Ballinadee Mill and flowed out above the mill wheel as shown above. The ‘over shot’ effect is a much more powerful technique than the traditional ‘under shot’, where the water would power the wheel from the middle or bottom.

The previous map shows both the River Pound and the man-made canals as they flow into the Bandon estuary and the Ballinadee Mill respectively. The Mill buildings were massive with some parts reaching seven storeys in height. A point backed up by the Griffith Valuation Field Books of 1850 which states that, by common standards of the day, the mill building complex was extensive.  Lewis also mentions in his book “Lewis’ Topographical Dictionary’, published in 1837, that Ballinadee “contains a large flour-mill of great power, which was much improved in 1836”.

 The main flour mill was forty-six feet long, twenty-six feet in breath and forty-one feet high. There was also an additional mill which was forty-three feet long, twenty-one feet in width and thirty feet high. It had several stores, one of which was eighty-one feet long, twenty-two feet wide and twenty-two feet high. A large drying kiln was present whose proportions were thirty-three feet long, twenty feet wide and twenty feet high. The water mill itself was twenty-six feet high. It had fifty two buckets and the wheel made three revolutions in one minute. This worked two pairs of French grinding stones; one pair of Irish grinding stones; one pair of Schilling stones with a balling and a brushing machine for drying flour.  The Ballinadee mill was described as a bolting mill.  Bolting is the process where ground flour is sieved several times to improve its texture.  For example, the millstones would be set far apart initially and would have yielded two grades of flour.  The leftovers from the bolting of this flour would be reground on millstones set more closely together and more of the second grade flour would be produced.  There would then be a third grinding and bolting of the left-overs of the second grade flour.  In periods of scarcity, grains could be bolted up to seven times producing several varieties of flour, including white and several types of bran.  There were a number of improvements made to the bolting process over the years, including jarring the flour through a cloths of differing material, each producing different flour textures.

The Mill played an integral role in the survival of the local community during famine times. The Great Irish Famine resulted in the death of approximately one and a half million people and the exodus of another million to the four corners of the globe. An over-reliance on the potato for domestic consumption led to this disaster.  When ‘blight’ <em>Phytophthora infestans</em> first appeared in county Cork in September of 1845, Europe and the United States had already been ravaged by its affects. British government apathy and inequality within Irish society created a perilous situation where starvation and endemic unemployment decimated the Irish population.

Although blight was the main catalyst for the famine, the unequal land tenure system exacerbated the problem of widespread deprivation.  The landlord of the area would rent out his land to local farmers. Information regarding rents paid to landlords is unavailable for Ballinadee.  However, data from rent collections in the local townlands of Kildarra and Knockroe around this period are extant. The following is an excerpt from rents paid by inhabitants of these townlands prior to the famine:

Extra man power was required to help run the land, therefore, farmers gave a small dwelling and a plot called a conacre to poor agricultural labourers in return for work. The poor labourer represented the majority of the population and was affected most acutely by the famine. With his small plot of land the labourer had to sustain not only himself and but his usually large family. The potato soon became the food source relied upon most as it is a crop that produces well in limited ground. When the disastrous potato crop of 1846 occurred, a crisis ensued that brought untold suffering and disaster to majority of the people of this country.  It shook society to its very foundations and led to consequences that affected Irish and world history.

    Millions of poor Irish struggled to feed themselves and their children.  Many emigrated in search of a better life while even more succumbed to the desperate conditions. Although the British government employed a repugnant laissez faire policy towards Ireland at this time, there was a small amount of government support for the dreadful situation. Ballinadee Mill played a crucial part in alleviating some of the local suffering. During this period, the Healy family took over the running of the mill and had obtained a Government contract to make and distribute biscuits and meal to the needy. It became a focal point for many starving people who journeyed considerable distances from all areas of West Cork to obtain its precious food. We are grateful for the family letters written in 1916 by Sr. Baptist, a nun in Tralee Convent and daughter of one of the Healy brothers.  In her letters she recounts what she learned from her mother about the famine times in this village. She explains that in the morning mill workers would go out into the fields to assist people who were too weak to make it to the mill for food.  A lot of these starving people died on their way to Ballinadee and thus created a problem regarding burial of their bodies, the nearby townland of Kilgobbin was utilised for extra space. An extract from her letters is reproduced below.

“In the famine years, my dear Father, Uncle Matt and Uncle Thomas took Ballinadee Mills, and got a contract from the Government for making and sharing out biscuits and meal to the poor starving people. Dear Mamma’s people (Mary McCarthy) were well-to-do-farmer here at Kilgobbin, and it was in this way that she met my Father.
She often told us, how the poor starving people used to take a short cut to the mill to get food, through her Father’s fields, and were several times found dead in the morning. She also told us, that many a time they placed burning sheaves of straw round the dying to restore them to life in her Father’s barn.” 

It can be seen from another letter reproduced below, that in 1845 the local authorities performed a study into the seriousness of the situation. 
<div class="well">
    <blockquote>
        Lougueville,<br/>
November 22nd 1845<br/>
<br/><br/><p>
My dear Lord Bandon, 
        </p>
<p>
	I beg leave to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship’s letter relative to the potato crops. As to the extent of the injury already sustained, although it varies in different localities often in fields separated only by a fence. The amount of injury is generally supported to extend to one third of the crop. The proportion injured being greatest in any good ground, and bad in wet, boggy ground. This third in general is not lost; the second part of the diseased potatoes being good food and the whole when steamed being good food for horses and pigs. 
</p>
        <p>
	During the last three weeks the disease has not increased, on the contrary, potatoes that three weeks past were not fit to be eaten bearing a very bad smell when boiled, have now lost that smell and are except the unsound part [are] fit to be eaten.
</p>
        <p>
	The potatoes which were taken out of the ground earlier have received most injury; not having been sufficiently ripe when dug. The general crop was most abundant, so that probably the supply will be sufficient. The prospect is certainly much better at present than it was last month. However, it is evident that every year the potato crop becomes more uncertain and subject to failures that some years past were unknown.
</p><br/><br/>
<p>        Have the honour,<br/>
		Dear Lord Bandon<br/>
		Yours very faithfully,<br/>
		Michael Longfield

The letter was sent to Lord Bandon, a major landlord and chief representative of the British in the region and suggested that the potato crop yields were improving after a period of wide-scale panic where people had started to prematurely dig up unripe potatoes due to a diminishing supply of food. A note of caution was struck by the author when he stated that crops had become uncertain due to unknown problems but his naive assertion that “probably the supply will be sufficient” must have created a false sense of comfort for the authorities. This was later shattered by the onset of a major outbreak of blight in 1846.

After the wide-spread blight in 1846 and its ensuring disastrous effects, Ireland did not experience blight in 1847. The lack of potato seed caused by the previous year’s disease and disputes between the impoverished labours and farmers set the stage for an utterly catastrophic year. As a result of disagreements over conacre, agricultural labourers had nowhere to turn to except the Public Works or as a final resort to the dreaded workhouse. The nearest workhouse to Ballinadee was situated in the town of Bandon and it can be seen in its records that the situation became extremely dire in 1847. The account for the weekly death toll and workhouse numbers from September 5th 1846 to March 6th 1847 is reproduced below.

Road-building was the main focus of the Public Works initiative, which was established to provide work and an income for the destitute. Half a million people were employed on the roads in early 1847 with each being paid an average of 10 pence per week. Public works initiated by grants from the Board of Works allowed workmen to earn wages to pay for imported Indian meal.  However, the importation of Indian meal rapidly rose due to the lack of government intervention and by early 1847 the price of Indian meal had reached the exorbitantly high price of £19 per ton. Indian meal had to be secretly organised by Robert Peel, British Prime Minister. Unbeknownst to his party he imported £150,000 worth of Indian meal for Ireland’s starving population. This Indian meal was distributed to local relief committees at a reduced price.

In Ballinadee the main Public Works activity involved building a road from the townland of Peafield down to the riverside. This was part of a larger scheme created by the Bandon Board, to link trade from Bandon to the navigable part of the river with the aim of improving transportation and developing employment and the economy.  Also the plan included a proposal to deepen the Bandon River to make it more navigable. A letter from the chairman of the Bandon Board of Works outlining this initiative is presented below

    <div class="well">
    <blockquote>
        <p>
That it is the opinion of this board that the immediate completion of the road of the town of Bandon to the deep water of the Bandon River would not merely give additional employment but open a facility for the private enterprise during the present Spring and Summer.
</p>
        <p>
That a memorial will be forwarded to the board of works for this board to request the board to take the immediate completion of said works and opening of the same at the earliest time possible.
</p>
        <p>
Signed <br/>
Chairman of the Bandon Board.

However at a later stage, a JC Walker from the Office of Public Works denied an application for a loan to finish the construction of the road citing that it was not believed that the applicants had enough capital to secure the repayment of the loan. He rather callously pronounced in a period of great hardship and desperation, that the OPW would not be turned into “bankers to provide capital to the contractors throughout the country”, contractors who were building projects to alleviate the suffering. 

    <div class="well">
    <blockquote>

Sir,<br/>

<p>
    With reference to the memorial forwarded by your letter of the 25th alto, from the poor law guardians of the Bandon Union, praying for an advance of money, less presented for the construction of a line of road from Bandon to deep water and also for a loan to the contractor to enable him to complete his contract satisfactorily and having submitted it to the Guardian of the board, I am directed to state that they have no power to lend money except on goods security.
</p>
        
<p>
If the merchants of Bandon and others are very anxious to have the road completed, the board will on there giving a bond for the sum required to make the portion not present for, advanced the security (....unreadable…) charged to a presentment at the next assize
 </p>
   <p>
With respect to advancing money to a contractor, to enable him to carryon, expeditionaly (sic) his work, such a principal has always been objected to and several similar applications have been heretofore refused as it would be converting the board into bankers to provide capital to the contractors throughout the country. I returned the papers forwarded in your letter.

The parallel initiative to deepen the river was keenly supported by the Kinsale Relief Committee and also by the Innishannon Committee. The Innishannon Relief Committee sent an unsuccessful appeal for funds which also contained a plea by a group that worked on the river called the sand lighters (sand boats that drew sand from the mouth of the river to Innishannon). These were again rejected by JC Walker of the OPW on the 29th May 1846. The Innishannon request is reproduced below.

Under an act of Government called the Labour Rate Act introduced in early 1847, the complete cost of providing finance for the famine-stricken was placed on the shoulders of the landlords and rate-paying farmers. This was introduced to as replacement for the Public Works scheme. However, in practice it was extremely difficult and expensive to collect any rates in Ireland at the time due to the increase of insurmountable debts.  The huge levels of unemployment and high prices ensured that a steady stream of ‘paupers’ now inundated the country’s workhouses, which were already suffering the strain of overcrowding.

In a second attempt to avert a large-scale human catastrophe, the British government passed the ‘Soup Kitchen Act’ also known as the ‘Act for the Temporary Relief of Destitute Persons in Ireland’ in February of 1847. The soup was actually a ‘stirabout’ of three parts Indian meal to one part cooked rice. By the summer of 1847 it is said that three million Irish people were relying on this food aid for survival. However, the distribution of soup ceased operation in September 1847, being replaced by Outdoor Relief. It provided contracts for food distribution in a number of centres. Ballinadee mill itself was one such centre and it, under the direction of the Healy family, supplied biscuits and meal to the destitute, which in many cases had travelled considerable distances for sustenance. 

By mid-1846, six hundred and forty eight local relief committees comprising county officials, poor law officers, local clergy of all denominations, gentry and businessmen had become established under the Relief Commission Act of 1845. Ballinadee parish had its own Relief Committee.  My research in the National Archives unearthed the following letter from the newly-formed Ballinadee Famine Relief Committee:

  <div class="well">
    <blockquote>
        <p>

</p>
 <p>

Ballinspittle too had its own individual committee, as it was regarded as a separate parish at the time for famine purposes. Grants from the Relief Commission in Dublin were bequeathed in relation to the level of money gathered independently by the local committees.  By 1846 the famine had badly affected Ballinadee area and at around the turn of the year at least two collections were organised by the newly formed Ballinadee Relief Committee.  This committee received the following sums from the under- mentioned individuals in a collection made in late 1846.

However, in less than two weeks another pleading letter begging for support was again sent, this time by the Parish Priest. He writes astonishingly there were over two thousand starving people in Ballinadee. This is quite an astounding figure an outstanding figure when compared to the village’s present population of four hundred and twenty five (Census, 2006). Tradition in the locality states that an influx of malnourished people from around West Cork swelled the populace dramatically. Deprived of food they were driven, by lure of employment in the OPW schemes and the food of the local mill, to seek refuge and sustenance in Ballinadee. It cannot be imagined what deplorable and horrendous conditions they must have had to endure at the time. The following distressing letters, found in the National Archives, speak to us a little of the misery, disease and apparent hopelessness of the situation. As can be read in the first of the letters, disease was widespread with the death rate in the village a horrifying ten per week

To add to the already dismal situation there seemed to be several administrative mix-ups. For instance the Earl of Bandon either forgot or made a mistake when sanctioning the Ballinadee Relief Committee. Such bureaucracy in times of great want must have created a mood of intense frustration and anger.  A further letter was sent by the local Parish Priest from his residence at Kilgobbin pleading that the situation should be resolved urgently.

	You will see by the accompanying letter of the Earl of Bandon that his lordship sanctioned the appointment of the Ballinadee Relief Committee near Bandon some weeks ago and that he not having communicated the fact to the Government arose from some mistake or forgetfulness. I dare say before this reaches his lordship, as he says in his letter will have corrected the mistake by letter and will thereby enable the commissariat to send us more liberal supplies.

Sir,
            </p>
	<p>The Secretary of the Ballinadee Relief Committee having forwarded to me your answer of the 17th of January re applications for funds, I think it is right to state that the Committee did receive my sanction as a Relief Committee in the month of February last. Although by an error it was omitted to be reported to the Commissariat General.

Your obedient servant, <br/>

Four days later a doctor called Samuel Orr who served as physician for the area of Innishannon and Ballinadee bore witness to the horrors that were being inflicted on the people of Ballinadee. He recounts how as a result of the cessation of Public Works scheme four hundred and ninety men were left without work. The knock effect of this on their families resulted in approximately two thousand people without subsistence. Disease, hunger and anger were rampant in the community, culminating in an attack on the Mill in a desperate effort to get food.

 </p>
 <p>Sir, </p>
         <p>
	I am a member of the Ballinadee Relief Committee and Physician to the dispensary established there. I beg to lay before you the deplorable state of that parish. About 3 weeks back all the public works in the parish were stopped in which 490 men were employed which left them and their families amounting to nearly 2000 without any means of support. The farmers in the parish being very small holders and being very poor because the labourers [have] no chance of employment.  I do not think there are 20 farmers in the parish who would pay 5p a week to a labourer, which with the very few gentry residing leaves them in much misery. The funds of the Relief Committee being small and not yet receiving a grant from Government leaves the Committee at present in debt as they were obliged to give meal liberally since the works were stopped, to try to save them from starvation, but I regret to say several in the parish have died  from want within the last fortnight. The Committee have issued £72 worth of meal gratuitously, besides a large quantity of soup. The people bore their suffering very patiently until the last week when they attempted an attack on the only mill in the parish. I regret to say fever and dysentery is spreading rapidly in the parish and only [if] temporary fever hospitals are established, the mortality will be fourfold. I beg to enclose a note I have just received from the parish priest written in a hurry soliciting an answer to this.

I beg to remain your obedient servant,<br/>

Letter to local Ballinadee doctor, Dr Orr

	       It would be well if you wrote to Mr Hanley Esq. secretary Dublin Castle, Dublin making the misery of Ballinadee with 1,500 without any means of support. It may cause them to deal more liberally with us. You may also add that the Secretary…

The fate of those two thousand impoverished souls is unknown but in the context of such national suffering it could be concluded that their outcome might not be a pleasant one. The Great Irish Famine finished in 1851 although blight and hunger would inflict the Irish for several subsequent decades. However, these were less severe and did not lead to such devastating outcomes because of several complex reasons. The post famine economy became much more robust. The growth in the numbers of railways inproved transportation efficency. The increasing wealth in urban areas meant alternative sources of food and employment were available. Access to new farm machinery lead to better farming techniques. A wholesale reorganisation of the land structure also occurred. This began with the Encumbered Estates Act 1849 which allowed estates that had amassed huge debts during famine times to be sold without the debts needing to be cleared. It completely changed the land structure in Ireland. The large estates who were debt-ridden and heavily mortgaged because of the famine and the resulting Labour Rate Act which put the onus on them to provide aid for the destitute, were divided up and sold to smaller farmers. These holdings were on a better ecomonic footing to ward off crop failure and economic depression. The banning of subdivision of land between sons, coupled with the dramatic rise in emigration, increased the average farm holding, thus enabling tenant farms to diversify in terms of produce grown.
When the Government withdrew the grant the Healy’s left Ballinadee and went their separate ways.  One brother, Matthew, went to Australia, taking all of his family with him.  Maurice, one of his sons, was not far from ordination before he left, he later became editor of the Bendigo Advertiser in Australia. John Healy and his wife Mary moved to Barleyfield Mill (located between Kilbrittain and Bandon) and farm. They also had a house in Castle Street Bandon where they sold the meal and flour ground at Barleyfield. John Healy died a relatively young man in 1856. Thomas Healy, on leaving Ballinadee, took his family to the United States during the 1850s where a new and interesting chapter in the Healy family history began. Thomas Healy was the father of Captain J.J Healy, whose extraordinary exploits are described in Stop Four.
